## Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall Problem was popularized from the television game show Let's Make A Deal. You are presented with three doors; one has a large cash prize, such as a car, behind it while the other two hide more undesirable prizes, such as a goat. You pick any door you would like, then oen of the two doors you did not pick is opened that hides the goat. You are then given an option to either stick with the door you picked, or switch to the other one.

## Motivation

According to Steve Selvin, who used conditional probability to figure out which is the better choice, you have a higher probability, 2/3 chance to be more specific, of winning if you opt ot switch doors than you do if you were to stay with the one you originaly picked, 1/3 chance if you were to stay with you original choice. Our objective of this applet is to show that you do have a much higher chance of winning if you are to switch doors rather than sticking with the one you originally picked.
