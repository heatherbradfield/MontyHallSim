## Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall Problem was popularized from the television game show. You are presented with three doors; one has a large cash prize, such as a car, behind it while the other two hide more undesirable prizes, such as a goat. You pick any door you would like, then they open one of the doors you did not pick that contains a goat. You are then given an option to either stick with the door you picked, or switch to the other one.

## Motivation

Our objective of this applet is to show that you do have a much higher chance of winning if you are to switch doors rather than stick with the one you originally picked. Using conditional probability, Steven Selvin was able to figure out which option contestants should opt for. He figured out that contestants had a higher probability, 2/3, if they switch doors rather than stay with their original pick, which has a 1/3 chance of hiding the car.
